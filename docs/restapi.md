# REST API

Here is the description of `Seismo` REST interface.

## Authentication

Clients have to authenticated in order to access API. We used simple authentication flow, based on GitHub. Authenticated users are generating [Personal Tokens](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use).

There is a configuration file, there you specify GitHub accounts that are permitted to access API.

```js

// config.js

var config = {
	auth: {
		users: [
			'alexanderbeletsky',
			'voronianski'
		]
	}
};
```

API endpoint,

```plain
HTTP POST http://analytics.host/auth
```

```js
var payload = {
	token: 'GITHUB_PERSONAL_TOKEN'
};
```

If personal token belongs to user specified in configuration file, the permissions are granted. Access token is returned to client. Access token is used as either `X-Access-Token` request header, or `?access_token=` query parameter or `token` cookie value.

## Application ID

Application ID is association between events and application that generates it. One server could handle as many as needed.

## Posting Events

```plain
HTTP POST http://analytics.host/api/events/:app-id

{

```plain
HTTP POST http://analytics.host/api/events/:app-id

{
	event: {id: 'app-start', event: 'application started'},
	data: {}
}
```

With additional event payload,

```plain
HTTP POST http://analytics.host/api/events/:app-id

{
	event: 'application started',
	data: {environment: 'production'}
}
```
