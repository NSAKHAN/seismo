# Analytics

### Sum reporting

Simple count function to sum up events, e.g. "number of logins per day", "number of app server exceptions per week" etc.

`/api/reports` API [endpoint](/restapi.md) is responsible for that.

### Data Grouping

Grouping of events by different parameters, e.g. "group of user emails logged today", "group of user emais clicked shared by week" etc.

`/api/groups` API [endpoint](/restapi.md) is responsible for that.

### Other proposals?

TDB.
